"""Multi-root, recursive git-repo discovery for the Drift Detector inventory scanner.

Pure filesystem discovery (pathlib only, no git subprocess): a directory "is a repo"
iff it contains a `.git` entry. Discovery does not descend into a found repo (its
submodules/vendored `.git` dirs are not separate repos to scan) nor into common
noise directories (`_SKIP_DIRS`).

Repo *identity* (the diff/tracking key) is derived deterministically and
independently of the order of `roots`:
- each repo's "home root" is the nearest ancestor root (longest path prefix);
- the base identity is the repo's path relative to that home root (or the home
  root's basename when the repo *is* the root);
- a repo whose *resolved* path escapes every root (an in-tree symlink pointing
  outside all roots) has no ancestor root — it falls back to its in-tree walk
  path relative to the root it was discovered under;
- if two *different* repos would collide on the same identity (e.g. two roots
  that share a basename), each is disambiguated by prefixing with its root's
  path relative to the common ancestor of all roots — unique by construction,
  since distinct absolute paths stay distinct relative to a shared prefix.
