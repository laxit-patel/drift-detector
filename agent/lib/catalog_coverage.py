"""Per-vendor catalog coverage: is this vendor's retirement list actually checked?

The shape verdict (agent/lib/shapes.py) answers "can we SEE this repo's calls?". This
answers the other half — "have we been TAUGHT what this vendor retires?" — because the
tool was honest about the first and silent about the second, and a vendor with 272
detected call-sites and no catalog entries rendered exactly like a clean one.

The unit is an ATTESTATION, not an entry count, and the difference is the whole design:

    entry count   a claim about our own file. Gameable — one junk entry flips a vendor
                  from "unaudited" to "audited" — and unknowable, because completeness
                  cannot be judged from the inside. eBay had twelve entries while the
                  vendor's page still listed operations we lacked.
    attestation   a claim about the world: somebody opened this vendor's canonical
                  deprecation page on a stated date and reconciled it.

So a vendor with entries but no attestation is UNAUDITED. That is deliberate, and it
grades our own eBay coverage honestly rather than flatteringly.

Deterministic: `now` is a pipeline input, so the same inputs give the same verdicts.
