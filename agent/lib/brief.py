"""Render an ABSORPTION.md brief for one flagged repo — everything a maintainer (or the
assimilator agent) needs to teach the scanner this repo's shape, in ONE file, so nobody hunts.

A pure, deterministic renderer over inventory.json: byte-identical for identical input, zero
tokens, no network — so it belongs in the scan-path codebase. The flag issue carries a short
bootstrap; this is the full context (uncapped blind spots, the closed families, the rails).
