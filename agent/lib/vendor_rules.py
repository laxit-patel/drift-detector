"""Render the ast-grep endpoint rule pack (discover-then-classify + allowlist recall):

- ONE broad rule matches every `http(s)://` string literal → we classify each host in
  Python (agent.lib.classify_url), so un-catalogued vendors still surface.
- PLUS one rule per catalogued vendor matching its domain literals → host-only
  references with no scheme (e.g. `'api.mailgun.net'` in a config) are still caught.
- PLUS the shape rules: versioned resource-path literals, PHP egress sinks, and the
  getHost()-concat idiom.
Matching is by tree-sitter node kind, so it is comment-safe by construction.

# ── Egress sinks: "this line makes an outbound HTTP call" ──────────────────────────────
#
# Until now only PHP had these, so `shapes.verdict()` returned UNKNOWN/no-egress-signal
# for seven of eight languages — honest, but it meant a JS or Go repo could never be
# scanned with confidence. These close that.
#
# EVERY pattern below was run against a real fixture in that language before being added.
# That is not ceremony: a pattern that looks correct can match nothing silently (PHP's
# `kind: string` matched only single-quoted strings and lost nine call-sites, including a
# vendor host), and a sink rule that matches nothing degrades exactly like having no rule
# at all — except it also reports coverage it does not have.
#
# Deliberately EXCLUDED as too noisy without argument-shape analysis:
#   php     file_get_contents / fopen — usually filesystem
#   go      $C.Do($$$)                — sync.Once.Do and every builder .Do() in Go
#   js      got($$$)                  — a single common word; too easy to shadow
# The rule is the one PHP already followed: a sink that cries wolf is worse than a gap,
# because the gap is reported and the false positive is believed.
#
# Go needs `context` + `selector`: a bare `http.Get($$$)` is not valid Go at top level, so
# ast-grep cannot parse the pattern and silently matches nothing. Verified: the bare form
# returns 0 matches on a file where the call plainly exists.
