"""The shape store: an honest, per-repo account of what the scan could and could NOT see.

The coverage grade answers "did anything go unattributed?". That is not the same
question as "do I even have rules for this repo's languages?" — and conflating them
is how a scanner goes silently blind. A Go repo with no Go egress rules produces no
residue at all, so it would grade HIGH: "clean" and "I cannot see here" look
identical. The shape record separates them:

  attributed   -> what we resolved
  residue      -> what we saw but could not resolve   (the grade's input)
  signalCoverage -> which rule kinds exist for the languages actually present
                    (the thing a grade cannot tell you)

`verdict` is KNOWN only when both hold: every meaningfully-present language has
egress-signal coverage, AND nothing is left unattributed. Anything else is UNKNOWN
with `reasons` drawn from a closed vocabulary, so the eval harness and the runtime
speak the same language about failure modes.

Reasons reuse agent/eval/corpus.TAXONOMY, plus `no-egress-signal` for the gap the
taxonomy never needed a word for (the eval only ever scored PHP corpora).
