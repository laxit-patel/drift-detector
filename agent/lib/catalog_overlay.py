"""The catalog OVERLAY — a writable, git-versioned layer over the read-only package catalogs.

The package YAMLs (vendors / idioms / vendor_sunsets / catalog_attestations) ship inside the
plugin and the container image, where they are READ-ONLY. The Learn loop grows the two
indexes by ABSORBING entries, and those must land somewhere the deterministic scan can read
on its next run — a rebuild of the image is not an option per scan. That somewhere is
`$DRIFT_CATALOG_DIR`: in production, a directory in the `drift-ops` persistence repo.

Every loader reads `package baseline + overlay`, baseline FIRST so the order is deterministic
(CLAUDE.md principle 3). An absorbed idiom or sunset therefore tunes the very next scan with
no code change and no image rebuild. Unset env var → no overlay → exactly today's behaviour.
The overlay is additive and git-reviewed (principle 4: the catalog is data, reviewed).
