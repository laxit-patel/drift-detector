"""Mechanical invariants over the dashboard payload — the checks that replace "looks right".

Rendered HTML cannot be checked by anything without eyes. Two bugs shipped in one
session because their tests ran a layer below the artifact a person reads:

  1. a tile reading `Sunsets 1` above twelve sunset findings, because actions grouped
     on (repo, vendor) and a vendor is not a job;
  2. twelve rows all labelled "eBay" — four of them identical — because the projection
     whitelists fields by hand and silently dropped the one carrying the operation.

Both are caught below WITHOUT rendering anything. Every check is a statement about the
payload that must hold no matter how the page is styled, so they survive CSS edits in a
way golden files do not.

Deterministic and dependency-free: pure Python over a dict.
