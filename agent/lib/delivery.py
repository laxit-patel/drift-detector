"""Turn drift.json findings into GitLab issues, idempotently, per repo, per audience.

The delivery is a PROJECTION of the verified payload, so it only ever runs after a green
`verify`. Two audiences (agent/lib/owners.py), each flagged repo gets ONE comprehensive
issue per audience, filed IN that repo's own project (not a central one), assigned:
  • DevOps actions (packages + runtime EOL) -> one issue per repo, assigned to the
    configured DevOps account.
  • Developer actions (vendor API sunsets + framework EOL) -> one issue per repo, assigned
    to the resolved repo owner (`resolve_owner`).
The draft-merge-request path is retired — `plan["mrs"]` is always `[]` for findings (the
`mr_*` helpers and `execute_plan`'s MR loop remain only for any pre-existing MRs already in
flight; nothing new is ever planned there).

Idempotency is the whole game — a re-scan must UPDATE, never duplicate. Issues carry a hidden
marker `<!-- drift-detector:<fp> -->` (namespaced per repo+audience via `repo_fingerprint`)
and a `drift-detector` label plus an audience label (`drift:devops` / `drift:developer`).
`build_plan` is PURE (payload + what already exists -> the create/update/close plan), so it
is testable without any network.
