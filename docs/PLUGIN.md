# Drift Detector — Claude Code Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that scans a folder of cloned repos for **code-level third-party
integration usage** (which APIs/SDKs each project uses, `file:line`, versions) and reports it
**in chat** — with the heavy work done by cheap, deterministic Python (Opengrep), not by an
expensive autonomous LLM agent.

## What it is

- **Slash command** `/drift-detector <folder> [more-folders...]` — runs a scan, points you at the
  report, and answers follow-up questions by querying the produced inventory (the "IR"), never by
  re-scanning. Run `/drift-detector` with no path and it asks which folder(s) to scan;
  `/drift-detector doctor` checks prerequisites.

The cost model: the scan is a deterministic static-analysis run (**zero LLM tokens**); Claude
spends tokens only on the summary + interactive Q&A. Contrast with an autonomous agent doing the
whole scan itself.

## Install (teammates)

The plugin is distributed as a Claude Code **marketplace** (this git repo). To install:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/laxit-patel/drift-detector
/plugin install drift-detector@tops-tools
```

Then run `/drift-detector <folder>` (see Use below). The first run bootstraps itself.

## Prerequisites

Just **`uv`** (recommended — https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) **or** python ≥ 3.11 with `venv`, and internet access on the first run. The bundled runner `bin/drift-scan` creates a plugin-local venv and installs the scan engine (semgrep) itself — **no separate Opengrep/Semgrep install, no manual Python setup**. Later runs reuse the venv. The scan **fails loud** if it can't provision the engine — no silent empty inventory.

## Use

```
/drift-detector /path/to/folder-of-cloned-repos
```

Git repos under `<folder>` are discovered **recursively** (at any depth). Pass multiple space-separated folders to scan several trees at once. The command:
1. checks the engine,
2. runs the scan (only repos whose git `HEAD` changed since last time are re-analyzed — a
   per-repo commit-SHA cache makes re-runs fast),
3. writes `<folder>/.drift-detector/{inventory.json, INVENTORY.md, DRIFT.md}`,
4. narrates a summary (top APIs by repo count, runtimes/frameworks, what changed since last scan),
5. answers follow-ups (*"which repos use SP-API?"*, *"who's on an old Node?"*) from
   `inventory.json` — the queryable shape-map — without re-scanning.

## Autonomous mode — `/drift-detector schedule <folder>`

`/drift-detector <folder>` runs the full **scan → audit** pipeline (the `run` subcommand) and offers
to install a **cron job** (default Sundays 7am) that re-runs it deterministically — zero LLM tokens —
and posts a summary to **Google Chat** if a webhook is configured. The agent shows the exact crontab
line and confirms before touching your crontab; `unschedule <folder>` removes it. Config + `cron.log`
live in `<folder>/.drift-detector/`.

## Audit — `/drift-detector audit <folder>`

Runs on the folder's existing `inventory.json` and checks it against **OSV.dev** (CVEs per
package) + **endoflife.date** (EOL runtimes/frameworks), classifying findings **DEPRECATED /
REVIEW** with cited sources. Deterministic (stdlib HTTP, no extra dependency, zero LLM tokens),
graceful offline. Checks the **declared manifest floor** version — verify against lockfiles.

## Outputs

- **`inventory.json`** — the IR: per-repo `{runtimes, frameworks, sdks, endpoints[{vendor,domain,
  version,file_count,files:[path:line]}]}` + rollups (`unique_apis`, `unique_api_versions`,
  `unique_packages`, `runtimes`) + coverage.
- **`INVENTORY.md`** — the human report (drift-first: what changed, then APIs/frameworks/runtimes/SDKs,
  per-repo endpoints at `file:line`, coverage).
- **`DRIFT.md`** — what changed vs the previous scan (new/removed APIs, SDK version bumps, runtime
  changes).
- **`AUDIT.md`** *(audit)* — vulnerability + EOL findings, ranked, per repo, each with a source + fix.
- **`bom.json`** *(audit)* — CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM (components + vulnerabilities).
- **`findings.sarif`** *(audit)* — SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub's Security tab.

## Notes & limits (v1)

- **Local folder(s)** input (clone orchestration is out of scope). Point it at one or more directories; repos are found recursively and multiple roots are deduped by real path.
- Endpoint **version** is best-effort from the URL on the matched line — `None` when a repo builds
  the URL from a base constant with the version appended elsewhere (needs dataflow).
- Detects hard-coded endpoints + manifest-declared SDKs; an SDK used only via its client library
  (no hard-coded URL) shows via the manifest, not as a call-site.
- Extend `agent/vendors.yaml` (vendors) and `agent/frameworks.yaml` (frameworks) as your stack grows.
- The audit uses Tier-1 sources (OSV + endoflife.date). Deferred: Tier 2 (registry abandoned/deprecated,
  e.g. `fzaninotto/faker`) + Tier 3 (community/early-warning) signals; lockfile-precise versions.
- Delivery connectors: Google Chat + local reports (shipped). Deferred: email, SARIF auto-upload to
  the GitHub Security tab, fleet auto-clone, systemd-timer/launchd (cron is Linux/macOS).
