# The scan container

Drift Detector ships in **two forms** of the same `agent/` code:

| | The plugin | **The container** (this doc) |
|---|---|---|
| Who runs it | a developer, in Claude Code | **GitLab CI**, headless |
| Contains | code + promptfiles (AI-assisted) | code + the ast-grep engine — **no AI** |
| Used for | Learn sessions + ad-hoc scans | the scheduled deterministic **Scan** |

The container is the **Scan** loop: pull it, run `drift run | verify | deliver`, done. It
holds only `agent/` and a pinned `ast-grep` binary — no `commands/` promptfiles and no LLM
client, so "no AI in CI" is a property you can verify by inspecting the image, not a promise.

## Determinism

Two runs must use byte-identical bits (CLAUDE.md principle 3):

- The engine is **version-pinned and sha256-verified** at build time, with **no fall-back to
  latest** — a mismatch or a failed fetch fails the build. The pin is kept identical to
  `bin/drift-scan`'s by `tests/test_container.py` (a version drift fails the test suite).
- The built image is **pinned by digest** in the consumer's CI (below), so every scheduled
  run pulls the exact same image.

Bumping the engine is a deliberate act: change `AST_GREP_VERSION` + `AST_GREP_SHA256` in the
`Dockerfile` and `DRIFT_AST_GREP_VERSION` in `bin/drift-scan` together, **after re-verifying
the ruleset**.

## Build

```bash
docker build -t drift-detector-scan .
```

The `.github/workflows/container.yml` action builds and pushes to
`ghcr.io/laxit-patel/drift-detector-scan` on every `v*` tag, tagging by version and by commit
sha. Make the GHCR package **public** once (repo → Packages → settings) so GitLab CI pulls it
with no cross-vendor secret.

## Run

The entrypoint is the `drift` CLI, so a subcommand is all you pass:

```bash
# scan a local checkout (offline for the ast-grep pass; audit reaches OSV/endoflife)
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/repo:ro -v "$PWD/.drift":/state \
  drift-detector-scan \
  run --root /repo --state /state --now "$(date +%F)"

docker run --rm -v "$PWD/.drift":/state drift-detector-scan verify --state /state
```

Exit codes (the CI contract): `0` clean · `2` error · `3` findings/gate · `4` couldn't
verify (nothing scanned, or a source unreachable — "couldn't check ≠ clean").

## In GitLab CI (illustrative — the full `drift-ops` bootstrap is a separate step)

The container is meant to run from the dedicated `drift-ops` persistence repo, which holds
the fleet config, the catalog overlay, and the committed-back state. A minimal shape:

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml in drift-ops — pin by DIGEST, not a moving tag
scan:
  image: ghcr.io/laxit-patel/drift-detector-scan@sha256:<digest>
  script:
    - drift run --root "$FLEET_GROUP_URL" --state state --now "$(date +%F)" --pull
    - drift verify --state state           # exit 4 fails the pipeline; exit 3 does NOT
  variables:
    GITLAB_TOKEN: $DRIFT_READ_TOKEN        # clone + group expansion; masked CI variable
```

`--pull` needs `git` (baked in) and a read token (`GITLAB_TOKEN`/`DRIFT_GIT_TOKEN`, read at
run time, never stored). `drift deliver` (the two issue streams) and committing state back to
`drift-ops` are the next build steps.
